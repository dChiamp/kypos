KYPOS

https://kypos.herokuapp.com/

An app to connect people to urban gardens.

Find Gardens near you.

Post your unsed garden space for others to cultivate.

Foster community and healthy living.

Why?

Currently there is no latform for people interested in gardening to find local spots to garden.
As people become more interested in local and sustainable food, "gardens" are popping up everywhere - from unused empty lots to planters over pavement.  

Kypos is a place for people to find these places and come together.

-Create a profile and start finding gardens near you!
-Search with Google Maps to search your neighborhood for gardens.
-Join local gardens to learn more about them, such as what produce they specialize in, or what times to come by andhelp out.
-Post messages on gardens' home pages to connect with fellow gardeners.
-Post your own garden to the community!
